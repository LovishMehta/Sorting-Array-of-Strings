Bubble for ascending order.
MAke use of two for loops.
     1. 1st "FOR LOOP" => will do the work of comparing the i th element with all the elements of the array and will bring the smallest 
        element in front.
     2. 2nd "FOR LOOP" => will make the 1st for loop to repeat from => i=0;i<length og array.
     
     for(int i =0; i < len; i++)
     {
        for(int j = 0+i ; j< len; j++)
          {
            if(arr[i]>arr[j])
            {
              swap elements
            }  
          }
     }     
    
    ALGORITHM EXAMPLE
    Outer FOR LOOP 
          i = 0
    inner FOR LOOP running 
     5 8 2 4 1    // j = 0 , Comparing 5 and 8 (5 is smaller than 8) so=> no change
     2 8 5 4 1    // j = 1 , Comparing 5 and 2 (5 is greater than 2) so=> 5 and 2 swapped
     2 8 5 4 1    // j = 2 , Comparing 2 and 4 (2 is smaller than 4) so=> no change
     1 8 5 4 2    // j = 3 , Comparing 2 and 1 (2 is greater than 1) so=> 2 and 1 swapped
     (In this way we got Smallest element of Array)
     
     outer FOR LOOP 
         i = 1
     inner FOR LOOP running (NOTE: j will start from j = 0+i => 1 because the smallest element has reached the front positon so
                                   no need to start and check from there, now we will find the 2nd smallest element)
        before starting => 8 5 4 2 ( leave 1 for now)
      5 8 4 2    // j = 1 , comparing 8 and 5 (8 is greater than 5) so=> swapped
      4 8 5 2    // j = 2 , comparing 5 and 4 (5 is greater than 4) so=> swapped
      2 8 5 4    // j = 3 , comparing 4 and 2 (4 is greater than 2) so=> swapped
      (In this way we got our 2nd Smallest of Array)
