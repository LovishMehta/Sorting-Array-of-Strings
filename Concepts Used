1. Double Pointer (Pointer to Pointer) in C
(link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/double-pointer-pointer-pointer-c/)
    Declaring Pointer to Pointer is similar to declaring pointer in C. The difference is we have to place an additional ‘*’ before 
    the name of pointer.
    Syntax:   int **ptr;    // declaring double pointer
    
2. Dynamic Memory Allocation in C using malloc(), calloc(), free() and realloc()
(link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/)
    “malloc” or “memory allocation” method is used to dynamically allocate a single large block of memory with the specified size.
     It returns a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any form.

       Syntax: ptr = (cast-type*) malloc(byte-size)

       For Example:
       ptr = (int*) malloc(100 * sizeof(int));

       Since the size of int is 4 bytes,this statement will allocate 400 bytes of memory. 
       And, the pointer ptr holds the address of the first byte in the allocated memory.
       
3. Multidimensional Arrays in C / C++
(link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multidimensional-arrays-c-cpp/)
     Array- Basics
     In C/C++, we can define multidimensional arrays in simple words as array of arrays. 
     Data in multidimensional arrays are stored in tabular form (in row major order).
     
syntax: data_type  array_name[size1][size2]....[sizeN];

        data_type: Type of data to be stored in the array. Here data_type is valid C/C++ data type
        array_name: Name of the array
        
Examples: Two dimensional array:
          int two_d[10][20];


4. Link between "2D Array" and "Double pointer".
refer link: https://www.techiedelight.com/pass-2d-array-function-parameter/

suppose you have a function 
                    int fun(int m, int n, int **arr)
               so in the above function Double pointer => **arr ,is the pointer to the first element of the 2D ARRAY. To assign values
               or access the 2D array one method is using arr[i][j]. => i = row element, and j = columns
         arr[0,0] => 1st element of the 2D array. In similar manner j=0   arr[0,0], arr[0,1], arr[0,2]
                                                                    j=1   arr[1,0], arr[1,1], arr[1,2]
                                                                    so on.....
